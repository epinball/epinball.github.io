      <description>GamePlan manufactured cocktail and upright pinball machines from 1978-1985. The cocktail machines were first, and used the &amp;ldquo;MPU-1&amp;rdquo; board. Roger Sharpe was contracted to design their first full/upgright pinball machine SharpShooter which was a huge success for the company. All upright pinball machines used the &amp;ldquo;MPU-2&amp;rdquo;.
Regardless of the version of the MPU board, they are very similar. The MPU-1 just had less memory than the MPU-2. Both are Z80 based systems, utilizing now obsolete 4 bit 6551 RAM, ROM space, and an 8255 for the PIA.</description>
