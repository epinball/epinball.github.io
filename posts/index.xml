      <description>Now that the revised board is back and populated, time for testing.
Prior, I used OSHPark as they are super quick, though pricing for 3 board can be a little pricy. I ordered the next revised boards from PCBWay, over in China. The process took about 10 days from ordering to delivery, and they turned out very well.
Changes from Version 1.0 The changes of this board included putting the 10k pull-ups for Port B, fixing the labels for the resitor values for the Comparator circuit, and the through hole mounts.</description>

      <description>Now that the board is back, it is assembly time! I created a bill of materials at Mouser, as they had most of the components in stock. For testing the prototype, I used parts I already had as well. Using a fishing tackle storage container, the parts were sorted out while waiting for the boards to arrive from OshPark.
When populating the board, start with the IC sockets first, followed by diodes, resistors.</description>

      <description>GamePlan manufactured cocktail and upright pinball machines from 1978-1985. The cocktail machines were first, and used the &amp;ldquo;MPU-1&amp;rdquo; board. Roger Sharpe was contracted to design their first full/upgright pinball machine SharpShooter which was a huge success for the company. All upright pinball machines used the &amp;ldquo;MPU-2&amp;rdquo;.
Regardless of the version of the MPU board, they are very similar. The MPU-1 just had less memory than the MPU-2. Both are Z80 based systems, utilizing now obsolete 4 bit 6551 RAM, ROM space, and an 8255 for the PIA.</description>
